This error occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a pseudo-class selector that's not properly escaped.  For example, using `@apply hover:text-blue-500` within a class definition will cause a parsing error because the colon in `hover:` conflicts with Tailwind's class naming conventions.

```css
/* Incorrect */
.my-button {
  @apply hover:text-blue-500;
}
```
